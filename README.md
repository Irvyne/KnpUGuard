[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/knpuniversity/KnpUGuard.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/knpuniversity/KnpUGuard)

This is a library is usable, but is *alpha*, and backwards compatibility
is not guaranteed yet. The original purpose was to get feedback and use-cases
from people so that we can merge this feature into Symfony itself
(see [symfony/symfony#14673](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/14673)).

For Symfony, see the [KnpUGuardBundle](https://github.com/knpuniversity/KnpUGuardBundle) library.
